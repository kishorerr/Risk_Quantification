"&& perl -e 'print """"X""""x4096'  login ",COMMAND INJECTION,"The given payload ""&& perl -e 'print """"X""""x4096'"" can be used in command injection attacks to chain commands and execute a Perl command to generate a 4096-byte string of ""X"" characters, potentially overflowing the system buffer.",LOW,LOW,NONE,Medium
"admin' and substring(password/text(),1,1)='7  login ",SQL INJECTION,"This attack is an example of Blind SQL Injection, where the attacker attempts to extract sensitive information from the database by modifying the original query in a way that causes the application to behave differently based on whether the injected condition is true or false, and using conditional queries to extract information. In this case, the attacker is attempting to extract the password character by character from a table called ""admin"", using the ""substring"" function and a conditional query to compare each character to the value ""7"".",HIGH,NONE,NONE,Medium
